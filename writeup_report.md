The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Preamble

The meaning of the term 'Behavioral Cloning' could be more clearly communicated by replacing it with 'Behavioral Mimicking' or 'Monkey See Monkey Do'.

The goal of a 'Behavioral Cloning' machine learning system is to observe input samples and associated actions
to learn the desired action for a given input.
A well trained system can then be applied to similar inputs.
In this project, the input is images captured from a driving simulator and the action to be mimicked is the steering angle.

This project could have been approached as a classification problem (with enough classes to provide 
	fine grained response)
However, it would be better to produce a continuous output value, hence the project is approached as a 'regression' problem.

The referenced Nvidia model is used as the starting point for the deep learning network architecture.

The provided simulator produces images of dimension width x height = 160x320.
There is a top horizontal band above the road surface that does not provide driving information and can be cropped.
Also, there is a bottom horizontal band with the car's hood that can be cropped.
Reducing input size will reduce the number of parameters that need to be trained.

## Architecture

The starting point used for the model architecture is the network described in the Nvidia paper 
[End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)

The Nvidia model takes input images of dimensional shape (66, 200, 3). Nvidia uses 3 input channels coded in YUV format.
Surprisingly, the Nvidia model does not use pooling or dropout layers, and we follow suit to start with.

We have observed that there is a top and bottom horizontal band that can be cropped without losing driving information.
In addition, there is a broad road surface area that doesn't provide much feature information,
it is the road edge feature information that is relevant.
It appears that the simulator image can thus be reduced in width without greatly affecting relevant input information.
With cropping and resizing of width, input images with dimensional shape (64, 64, 3) seems reasonable.
The much smaller input image size affects the resulting architecture.

The Nvidia model has 5 convolutional layers. 
With 5 convolutional layers for input image dimensions of 64x64 and the kernel and stride configurations used,
the fifth layer output dimension would be 1x1. This seems degenerate, so the fifth layer is dropped.

The Nvidia model has 3 fully connected layers.
The flattened layer has 1164 elements, whereas the model used has a flattened layer of 576 elements,
so it seems reasonable to drop the fully connected layer with 100 elements, and going straight to the 50 element layer.

The reduced image input size means much fewer parameters need to be trained,
resulting in shorter training cycles and allows more experimentation on the model.

The resulting model architecture is shown in the model below:

![Model Architecture](./model.png)

### Model Configuration (Compilation)

Optimizer used: [Adam (adaptive moment estimation)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8)
Adam "computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients"
Adam optimizer default parameter values were used.

The steering angle output is addressed as a regression problem, so the loss used is 'mean squared error'.

## Training

### Data Used

Lacking gaming skills to guide the car smoothly around the track, the Udacity provided dataset was used.

This data is split into training and validation datasets.

### System limitations

Generators are used to load batches of data (image files) from disk,
this avoids loading entire datasets into memory, likely exceeding main memory limits.

### Initial Results

Initially only ran model on 1 epoch to ensure the code was valid.
Surprisingly, running the resulting model, the car made it past the bridge. 
(Although it failed to negotiate the left turn after the bridge, and went off the road to the right.)

Once the code is confirmed to successfully execute, 
the model was trained for 10 epochs.
The results show that with each epoch, the training loss went down, whereas the validation loss has a slow increasing trend.
The losses are plotted in the accompanying figure, 
![Training and Validation Loss](./figure_model_loss.png)

This indicates that the model is **overfitted**.
The approaches for **addressing overfitting** include:

1. use more training data
2. various options in modifying the model, including dropout, pooling, weights regularization.

Various data scientists including Andrew Ng have stated that one key to making deep learning techniques work is enough data.
[Datasets Over Algorithms](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26587)

So to address overfitting, the first inclination is to add to the training dataset.

### Data Augmentation

The initial dataset can be transformed in various ways to add to the training data.

1. Flip the images (and the steering angle)
2. The simulator captures images from 3 cameras: left, center, right. The accompanying steering angle corresponds to the center camera.
   The left and right camera views are captured from a viewpoint roughly 3 feet to either side of center.
   The left camera view point can be considered to be the view point if the car has drifted 3 feet to the left.
   The desired steering angle for the left view point would be to correct towards the center.
   So the left camera steering angle is calculated by `center angle + correction angle`.
   The amount of correction is up for experimentation, too little and car drifts off road, too much and the car over-corrects and swerves off road.

Using these 2 techniques together, the resulting sample size is 6 times original size.

With this data set, the training and validation loss decrease over subsequent epochs as seen in this plot: ![Training and Validation Loss](./figure_model_loss_augment.png)

As was eventually seen after various trials,
adding data was enough to overcome overfitting, and the trained model successfully guided the car around the track.

### Model Variations

Various architectural options was used to modify the initial model to investigate possible improvements.
These trials are summarized in this section.

#### L2 Regularization
L2 regularization is used to adjust weights to a more even range, no high variance in weights and can be used to address overfitting.
The resulting training and validation loss look promising, the losses drop and converge.
This is plotted here: ![Training and Validation Loss](./figure_model_loss_augment_l2.png)

However, with L2 regularization, the car smashed up against left side of bridge.
Further investigation on root cause is needed.

#### Dropout
Dropout is tried after initial input layer and after the first convolutional layer.
Using the trained model, the car wassuccessful in negotiating track,
but the behavior did not seem better than without dropout layer

#### Maxpool size 2x2, stride 2x2
Max-pooling was tried after the 1st Convolutional 2D layer.
Because of the dimensionality reduction of max-pooling,
the first convolutional stride was reduced from 2,2 to 1,1.

The resulting trained model allowed the car to make it around the course, but car weaved around road some.

### Dropout, regularization, batch normalization, bears, oh my!
There are many options each with it's own set of dimensions for modifying the architecture.
Clearly there are too many options to experiment with in one project.
The best approach is to use proven prior work as starting points.
The Nvidia DAVE2 model is used is this project, there are many more.

## Postamble

A successful model found in this project was the initial architecture based on the Nvidia DAVE2 model.
It used an augmented data set created from the Udacity provided data set.

The car was driven on the simulator for over half an hour,
the car does not end up smoking on a pile of tires.

This architecture does not have pooling or dropout layers.
This empirical finding is congruous with the Nvidia DAVE2 model.

### Futures

There are many directions to explore including:

1. Convert RGB to YUV. This separates color from whether the scene is light or dark.
2. Explore other models including transfer learning models provided by Keras.
3. Explore what is simplest network that would work.

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. An appropriate model arcthiecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (model.py lines 18-24) 

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 20), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 18). 

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

####4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section.

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image3]
![alt text][image4]
![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
